# BDTI - Black Diamond Technology Initiative

BDTI is a small-scale, non-profit organization dedicated to offering **free**, **high-quality**, and **modern** workshops, courses, and one-on-one training in the vast and ever-evolving world of Information Technology.

## Founder and Team
The startup's board members, development team, outreach workers, and all other positions are managed by the founder, **Alexander Macleod**. Thanks to advancements in technology, tasks that would ordinarily take months or even years are now accomplished in hours or days with his toolkit of various AI models. Alexander's arsenal includes:

- **ChatGPT4** from OpenAI
- **Copilot** from Microsoft
- **Meta's Arsenal of AI Models**: Llama, Dolphin, Platypus, and other Large Language Models

With his self-determination and the skillset of his team of AI models, Alexander is confident in his ability to create, fix, build, learn, and teach. He is driven to provide opportunities to members of his communityâ€”opportunities that were not available to him when he was younger.

## Mission and Vision
This organization is committed to changing lives in Pictou County. Alexander dreams not only of changing lives but also believes in the transformative power of this initiative to **save lives**.
